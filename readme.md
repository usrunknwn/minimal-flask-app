REFLECTION
	I started off by making a simple layout in HTML. I wanted to box in the reflection, prompt and image into their own spaces. I didn’t want it to look plain as the one that was given, but I was less focused on the aesthetics of the site. In terms of the python I loaded and imported all the flasks and API keys. Then I went on to define some variables like result and image url. So I have a way to pull from them later. What I’m doing from here is giving the AI a role of “You are a Jungian psychoanalyst providing deep dream interpretations.". I set the temperature not too low since I want it to be a little creative. Then the image generation we use DALL-E 3 since we are pulling from OpenAI. We can’t simply copy the dream description and put it in for the image generation prompt. So we have a static text placeholder before the prompt saying “An abstract dream representation based on:”. This way we are able to define what the image is without confusing the AI, no matter what I type in the prompt. Then setting a low size for the generation would give me a quick response time. After all of that the “return” function outputs each result. I think a couple improvements that could be made are things like the token limit and or rate limits. I could also change the image generation machine to always output a dream-like scenario despite a vague prompt. Other than that most of my improvements would be CSS related and the redesign of the webapp. I know this is something I will focus a bit more on the A05 so I can have a feel for a good web app using AI for the final assignment.
